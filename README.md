## Abstract

This paper intends to empirically examine how R&D expenditures, imports of intermediate 
inputs and scale-economies influence the high-tech exports from Organization of Islamic 
Countries (OICs). In this context, the study assesses the predictions of the theories of 
international trade on comparative advantage, processing trade as well as new economic 
geography. The paper focuses on selected OICs that are aspiring to become technologically 
advanced by diversifying their production and export base from low-end products to high-tech 
products. To achieve this objective, these countries are investing on domestic R&D activities, and 
making efforts to attract foreign technologies and knowledge through imported inputs and 
foreign direct investment. Besides, they are restructuring their industries to benefit from scaleeconomies. Within this perspective, using the Empirical Bayesian technique, the paper concludes 
that R&D expenditures positively influence high-tech exports as predicted by traditional 
theories; while, economies-of-scale are relatively less effective in the promotion of high-tech 
exports. The variable import of electronics parts and components strongly support the presence 
of the phenomenon of processing trade. Based on these findings, the paper draws some 
implications for policy making to leverage high-tech exports from OICs.
